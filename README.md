key-hime is part of a personal project in partnership with [@lgstvo](https://github.com/lgstvo), where we work alongside each other trying to understand the challenges of implementing different kinds of malwares, security breaches, and anything related to cyber-security.

key-hime is built in golang and is a keylogger for windows. Her usage is intended for educational purposes and we do not take responsility in any bad usage of the tool.

The tool is hardcoded to send the data to the server running on ::0 (localhost) but the server and client can be easily changed to run on different machines. The client counts with the PORT and ADDRESS constants that hold the server data.
